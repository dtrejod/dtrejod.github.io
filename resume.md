- Automated the workflow of using SAN snapshots to duplicate and backup Oracle
  databases. Orchestrated by using custom Ansible modules and the VMware Python
  API.
- Designed and developed a NFS/CIFS Filer Auditing System using inline network
  replication feeding into a Bro IDS (Network Security Monitoring Software).
- Contributed to the development of low latency network benchmarks using Remote
  Direct Memory Access.
- Benchmarked experimental computer hardware including new CPUs architectures,
  L1/ L2 replication/switches devices, and various storage solutions.

**Neural Engineering Data Consortium**
SYS ADMIN - DATA SCIENTIST - BUDGET COORDINATOR
*August 2014 - Present*

Summer 2015 I was brought to head the development of the NEDC computer
cluster. This $30k HPC purchase was configured to best suit our research
group's batch processing needs. To go along with the computer cluster we
also brought online a locally hosted web/gitlab server to host the research
group's source code/project accomplishments.

Using records pulled from Temple University Hospital's (TUH) database we
put together the largest data corpus of clinical EEGs. The data is to be
used to train machine learning software that is used in normal/abnormal
EEG classification, and epilepsy detection. All our work is publicly
distributed online for other neural engineering researchers to use.

Concurrently I managed the half million in NEDC research funds looking to
maximize available expenditure. I worked alongside Temple Engineering's
business manager in keeping track of four different funds contributing
to our research.

DATABASE DEVELOPMENT INTERN
*May 2010 - August 2012*

In the summer of 2010, I obtained a position to help develop the standard
object catalog (database) for use with Systems Tool Kit (STK). I wrote
scripts to scrape online and internal databases that formed the basis for
the SOC.

During this time STK 10 was being developed and I was one of the first to
step through the complete tutorial ensuring its content was comprehensive.
As a side project, I worked with other employees in the company to create
promotional videography for the new release.

By summer 2012, I also had the chance to assist the IT department routine
computer maintenance. The position focused on the building and imaging of
new computers.
