# My Work Experience
<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-briefcase about-icon"></span>
**Neural Engineering Data Consortium**  
DEVOPS - DATA SCIENTIST - BUDGET COORDINATOR  
*August 2014 - Present*

Summer 2015 I was brought to head the development of the NEDC computer 
cluster. This $30k HPC purchase was configured to best suit our research 
group's batch processing needs. To go along with the computer cluster we 
also brought online a locally hosted web/gitlab server to host the research 
group's source code/project accomplishments. 

Using records pulled from Temple University Hospital's (TUH) database we 
put together the largest data corpus of clinical EEGs. The data is to be 
used to train machine learning software that is used in normal/abnormal 
EEG classification, and epilepsy detection. All our work is publicly 
distributed online for other neural engineering researchers to use.

Concurrently I managed the half million in NEDC research funds looking to 
maximize available expenditure. I worked alongside Temple Engineering's 
business manager in keeping track of four different funds contributing 
to our research.

**Analytical Graphics**  
DATABASE DEVELOPMENT INTERN  
*May 2010 - August 2012*

In the summer of 2010, I obtained a position to help develop the standard 
object catalog (database) for use with Systems Tool Kit (STK). I wrote 
scripts to scrape online and internal databases that formed the basis for 
the SOC.

During this time STK 10 was being developed and I was one of the first to 
step through the complete tutorial ensuring its content was comprehensive.
As a side project, I worked with other employees in the company to create
promotional videography for the new release.

By summer 2012, I also had the chance to assist the IT department routine 
computer maintenance. The position focused on the building and imaging of 
new computers.
