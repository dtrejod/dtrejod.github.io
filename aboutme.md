# <span class="fa fa-info-circle"></span> Introduction
My name is Devin Trejo. I'm an Electrical Engineering currently employeed
at Susquehanna International Group, LLP located in Bala Cynwyd, PA as a 
UNIX platform developer.

I am passionate to explore the new frontier of Cyber Security and applying
Engineering principals to new problems. During my time with the [Neural 
Engineering Data Consortium](https://www.nedcdata.org) I constructed
the NeuroNix supercomputer to conduct deep machine learning to clinical 
EEGs. Our research group was the first group from the College 
to successfully develop a secure enough computing environment to be housed
in Temple's main data center. I was part of the data team that put together
the largest EEG corpus which was mined by the group's algorithms. 

I am a programmer and system administrator with a strong Electrical 
Engineering background. I have been apart of big software projects including 
the implementation of self-configuring mesh networks, construction of 
autonomous robots, and data mining algos to analyze QVC sales data. 
I will occasionally do some simple web development such as this site you 
are currently reading now!

review my [resume](/resume).

# <span class="fa fa-archive"></span> The Blog
The Blog is a resource for me to archive my projects and show others
what I have accomplished. I hope people will find the information
on it useful for solving their own problems or to gain new insights in a 
area I cover.

# <span class="fa fa-plane"></span> Traveling
In my free time, I enjoy exploring new places and cultures. I have been to
a number of countries including: Italy, Bahamas, Costa Rica, Dominican
Republic, Canada, Croatia, France, Spain, Slovenia, Mexico. I've also
traveled inside the United States to the states of California, Florida, New
York, Nevada, and Massachusetts. Traveling has allowed me to see life in
new perspectives that can not be obtained anywhere else.
